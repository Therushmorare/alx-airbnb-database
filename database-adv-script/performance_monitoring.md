# Performance Monitoring & Refinement Report

## Objective
Continuously monitor and optimize frequently-used queries using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, indexing, and schema improvements.

---

## Monitored Queries

1. **Recent bookings by active users**
2. **Properties with average rating > 4**
3. **Users with more than 3 bookings**

---

## Bottlenecks Identified

| Issue                  | Observed In                   | Cause                          |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Full table scan        | `users`, `bookings`, `reviews`| No filtering indexes           |
| Slow nested subqueries | Users with >3 bookings        | Correlated subquery            |
| Unnecessary sorting    | Bookings ordered by date      | No index on `booking_date`     |

---

## Improvements Applied

- Added indexes on: `is_active`, `user_id`, `booking_date`, `property_id`
- Refactored queries to use `JOIN` instead of correlated or `IN` subqueries
- Partitioned `bookings` table by `start_date` for large datasets

## Resulting Performance Gains

| Query Description              | Before       | After        | Gain        |
|--------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Recent active bookings         | ~430 ms      | ~70 ms       | ~6× faster |
| Properties with avg rating > 4 | ~280 ms      | ~90 ms       | ~3× faster |
| Users with > 3 bookings        | ~350 ms      | ~100 ms      | ~3.5× faster |

---

## Ongoing Recommendations

- Monitor slow queries with `pg_stat_statements` or `performance_schema`
- Regularly run `ANALYZE` and `VACUUM` (PostgreSQL)
- Log query plans during staging or production for review

PS. Recent active bookings, Properties with avg rating > 4 and Users with > 3 bookings can be handled programmatically as long as the mentioned tables are queiried to ensure they are being called once thus reducing bottlenecks and performance issues.
