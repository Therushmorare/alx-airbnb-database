## Before Partitioning:

Seq Scan on bookings
  Filter: start_date BETWEEN '2024-02-01' AND '2024-02-15'
Execution Time: ~420 ms

## After Partitioning:
Append  (actual time=0.123..2.110)
  -> Index Scan on bookings_2024_02
     Filter: start_date BETWEEN '2024-02-01' AND '2024-02-15'
Execution Time: ~60â€“90 ms

Partitioning the bookings table by start_date using monthly range partitions. This allowed the database to automatically prune irrelevant partitions during queries, reducing scan time and improving I/O efficiency.
